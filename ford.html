          Ford Motor Company (commonly known as Ford) is an American multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered
          in Dearborn, Michigan, United States. It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The
          company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand, and luxury cars under its Lincoln
          luxury brand. Ford also owns Brazilian SUV manufacturer Troller, an 8% stake in Aston Martin of the United
          Kingdom and a 32% stake in China’s Jiangling Motors. It also has joint ventures in China (Changan Ford),
          Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), Turkey (Ford Otosan), and Russia (Ford Sollers). The
          company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family; they have minority
          ownership but the majority of the voting power. Ford introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of
          cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing
          sequences typified by moving assembly lines; by 1914, these methods were known around the world as Fordism.
          Ford's former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover, acquired in 1989 and 2000 respectively, were sold to the
          Indian automaker Tata Motors in March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010. In
          2011, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had marketed entry-level luxury cars in the United
          States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938.</br></br>
          Ford is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker (behind General Motors) and the fifth-largest in the world (behind Toyota, Volkswagen, Hyundai and General Motors) based on 2015 vehicle production. At the end of 2010, Ford was the fifth-largest automaker in Europe. The company went public in 1956 but the Ford family, through special Class B shares, still retain 40 percent of the voting rights. During the financial crisis of 2007–08 the company struggled financially but did not have to be rescued by the federal government, unlike the other two major US automakers. Ford Motors has since returned to profitability, and was the eleventh-ranked overall American-based company in the 2018 Fortune 500 list, based on global revenues in 2017 of $156.7 billion. In 2008, Ford produced 5.532 million automobiles and employed about 213,000 employees at around 90 plants and facilities worldwide.In March 2022, Ford announced that it would restructure the company into three separate divisions. Ford Model E is to focus on electric vehicles; Ford Blue is to focus on internal combustion vehicles and the existing commercial division is to be rebranded as Ford Pro, to focus on vehicle distribution and service.
